============================

Welcome to the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile open source project.  Titanium provides
a platform for web developers to build cross-platform, native mobile applications
using web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Currently, Titanium supports mobile smartphone operating systems such as Apple iPhone 
and Google's Android. However, we plan to support the RIM Blackberry and other 
platforms.

Titanium is licensed under the OSI approved Apache Public License (version 2). Please
see the LICENSE file for specific details.
